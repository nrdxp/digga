      Synopsis: flattenTree _tree_

      Flattens a _tree_ of the shape that is produced by rakeLeaves.

      Output Format:
      An attrset with names in the spirit of the Reverse DNS Notation form
      that fully preserve information about grouping from nesting.

      Example input:
      ```

            c = <path>;
          };

      Example output:
      ```
      {
        "a.b.c" = <path>;
      }
      ```

  rakeLeaves =
    /**
      Synopsis: rakeLeaves _path_

      Recursively collect the nix files of _path_ into attrs.

      Output Format:
      An attribute set where all `.nix` files and directories with `default.nix` in them
      are mapped to keys that are either the file with .nix stripped or the folder name.
      All other directories are recursed further into nested attribute sets with the same format.

      Example file structure:
      ```
      ./core/default.nix
      ./base.nix
      ./main/dev.nix
      ./main/os/default.nix

    The function, mkProfileAttrs, has been deprecated, you can now create profile sets
    with the standard importer, rakeLeaves. The formmat of rakeLeaves is a little different,
    because it doesn't recurse into directories with `default.nix` files in them. So some
    of your sub-profiles might no longer be collected. Make sure to update your profiles
    with that in mind;
    See https://github.com/divnix/digga/pull/29 for more details
